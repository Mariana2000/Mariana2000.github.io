We attended the Night Orienteering event held at Wenyu River Park in New Year's Eve. This is a relay match, and due to the limited number of participants, I handled the last three legs of our team(7 legs in total, the direct length increase with the leg index, the last three legs 2.0km, 2.3km, 2.7km separately). Finally we finished second.
