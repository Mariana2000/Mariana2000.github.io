## Welcome!
-----
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [School of Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics) at [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), advised by Prof. [Aaron Molstad](https://ajmolstad.github.io/).

Previously, I received my B.Eng. from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), with a minor in [Statistics](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/page/rcpy/bkpy/). I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Jingyi Zhang](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/jingyi-zhang/) and Prof. [Bingxin Zhao](https://www.bingxinzhao.com/) during my undergraduate study.

I have a broad interest in **statistics and biostatistics**. Driven by real world data, I am interested in tackling complex statistical problems emerging in fields such as biomedical science, environmental science and cybersecurity, with methodologies about (but not limited to) **dimension reduction, high-dimensional statistics, spatial statistics and causal inference**. 

In my spare time, I'm a big sports fan. I'm especially fond of **orienteering**, a sport challenging both mental and physical power, and I was a member of **Tsinghua Orienteering Team** during 2019-2023. Currently I'm a member of [OUSA](https://orienteeringusa.org/) and attend events held by [Minnesota Orienteering Club(MNOC)](https://www.mnoc.org/) occasionally. I will post some of my experiences or findings about orienteering in [Portfolio](https://mariana2000.github.io/portfolio/) and [Blog Posts](https://mariana2000.github.io/year-archive/). Beyond orienteering, I'm also rooted for Minnesota [Timberwolves](https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/), [Twins](https://www.mlb.com/twins) and [Vikings](https://www.vikings.com/).
