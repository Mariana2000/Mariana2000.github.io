## Welcome to my homepage!
-----
I am currently a senior student in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am majoring in Measurement, Control Technology and Instruments at the [Department of Precision Instrument](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/dpien/index.htm). I am also taking courses to obtain a minor degree in **statistics**. 

I will join [School of Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics) at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), Twin Cities as a Ph.D. student in 2023 Fall semester.

I have a broad interest in **statistics and biostatistics**. Driven by real world data, I am interested in tackling complex statistical problems emerging in fields such as biomedical science, environmental science and cybersecurity, with methodologies about (but not limited to) **dimension reduction, high-dimensional statistics, spatial statistics and causal inference**. Currently I'm working under the supervision of Prof. [Jingyi Zhang](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/jingyi-zhang/) at [Center for Statistical Science of Tsinghua University(TCSS)](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) on topics about optimal transport and dimension reduction. A recent working paper is now available in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00170). 

I was also fortunate to work with Prof. [Bingxin Zhao](https://www.bingxinzhao.com/) in the [Wharton Statistics and Data Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) during the past summer.

In my spare time, I'm a fanatic sports fan. I'm especially fond of **orienteering**, a sport challenging both mental and physical power, and I'm currrently a member of **Tsinghua Orienteering Team**. I will post some of my experiences or findings about orienteering in [Portfolio](https://mariana2000.github.io/portfolio/) and [Blog Posts](https://mariana2000.github.io/year-archive/).
