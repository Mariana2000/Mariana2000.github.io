### Welcome to my homepage!
-----
I am currently a junior student in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am majoring in [Measurement, Control technology and Instruments, Department of Precision Instrument](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/dpien/index.htm). I am also taking courses to obtain a minor degree in statistics.

I have a broad interest in statistics and biostatistics. Particularly I am interested in dimension reduction, high-dimensional statistics, spatial statistics, bayesian statistics and causal infernce. Currently I'm working under the supervision of Prof. [Jingyi Zhang](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/jingyi-zhang/) at [Center for Statistical Science of Tsinghua University(TCSS)](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) on topics about optimal transport and dimension reduction.

In my spare time, I'm a fanatic sports fan. I'm especially fond of orienteering, a sport challenging both mental and physical power, and I'm currrently a menmber of Tsinghua orienteering team.
